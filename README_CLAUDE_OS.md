> **Claude OS**: An operating system for collaborative AI development where Claude becomes an expert developer on your codebase, remembers everything you tell it, understands your entire project, and learns automatically.

---

## 🎯 What is Claude OS?

Claude OS is a **complete platform** that transforms Claude from a generic AI assistant into **your personal AI developer** through four integrated systems:

### The Four Pillars

1. **Claude Code**
   - Your AI IDE with skills and tools
   - Natural language interface for development

2. **Memory MCP** (`~/.claude/mcp-servers/memory/`)
   - Persistent memory across all sessions
   - Just say "Remember:" and context is saved forever
   - Instant recall without searching
   - Zero latency context retrieval

3. **Code-Forge** (Evolved from RAG)
   - Live knowledge base of your entire codebase
   - Semantic search on 130+ documents
   - Automatically updated via git hooks
   - Complete understanding of how everything works

4. **Git Hooks**
   - Automatic learning with every commit
   - Knowledge base that updates itself
   - No manual indexing required

---

## ⚡ The Game Changer

### Before Claude OS
```
Session 1: "Here's how our Block system works..."
→ I understand

Session 2: "How does Block 122 work again?"
→ I search KB (40-50 seconds)
→ Or you re-explain

Session N: "What was our decision about..."
→ I have no memory
→ You repeat context
```

### After Claude OS
```
Session 1: "Remember: Block 122 is a 43KB appointment form"
→ I save to memory

Session 2: "What did we work on?"
→ I recall automatically
→ Continue seamlessly

Session N: "What was that architecture decision?"
→ I remember (no searching)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Right Now!)

### Option 1: Save Something
```
You: "Remember: Block 122 is the most complex block we need to migrate"

→ I save it to Memory MCP
→ Instantly searchable forever
```

### Option 2: Ask What You Worked On
```
You: "What did we work on yesterday?"

→ I search memory automatically
→ Show you complete context
→ Zero search delay
```

### Option 3: Search Memory
```
You: "Show me my memories about Block deprecation"

→ I find all related memories
→ Display with zero latency
```
