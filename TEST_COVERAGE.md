- Each test file averages ~485 lines
- Comprehensive coverage of all major components

### Test Categories Covered

1. **Unit Tests**: ~70%
   - Individual component testing in isolation
   - Mock-based testing for external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**: ~30%
   - End-to-end testing of component interactions
   - Real file system and database operations

## Test Organization

### Test Markers

All tests are organized using pytest markers for easy filtering:

- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.api`: API tests
- `@pytest.mark.rag`: RAG-specific tests
- `@pytest.mark.embeddings`: Embedding-specific tests
- `@pytest.mark.document_processing`: Document processing tests

### Test Fixtures

Comprehensive test fixtures are provided:

- `clean_db`: Provides a clean database for each test
- `sample_kb`: Creates a sample knowledge base
- `sample_documents`: Creates sample documents with embeddings
- `sample_text_file`: Creates a sample text file
- `sample_pdf_file`: Creates a sample PDF file
- `sample_markdown_file`: Creates a sample Markdown file
- `api_client`: Provides a test API client

## Running Tests

### Command Line

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_sqlite_manager.py

# Run tests by marker
pytest -m unit tests/
pytest -m integration tests/
pytest -m api tests/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

### Continuous Integration

The tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

1. **Database Setup**: Tests use temporary databases
2. **Service Mocking**: External services are mocked when needed
3. **Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation
4. **Cleanup**: Resources are cleaned up after each test

## Coverage Gaps Addressed

The new test suites address the following gaps in the original test coverage:

1. **Missing Component Tests**: Added tests for all major components
2. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
3. **Integration Points**: End-to-end testing of component interactions
4. **Configuration Testing**: Full validation of configuration management
5. **Real-time Features**: Testing of conversation watching and file monitoring

## Future Test Enhancements

Potential areas for future test enhancement:

1. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and performance benchmarks
2. **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization testing
3. **Browser Testing**: Frontend integration testing
4. **Multi-user Testing**: Concurrent user scenarios
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Data backup and recovery testing

## Test Maintenance

To maintain test quality:

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep tests updated with code changes
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Track test coverage metrics
3. **Refactoring**: Regular test code refactoring
4. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation updated
5. **Review**: Regular code reviews for test quality
