## In Your Next Session

### Option 1: Save Something to Memory (Easiest)
```
You: "Remember: Block 122 is a 43KB appointment form with 4-step wizard"

→ I save it to Memory MCP
→ Done
```

### Option 2: Ask What You Worked On
```
You: "What did we work on yesterday?"

→ I search memory automatically
→ Show you complete context
→ No searching needed
```

### Option 3: Search Your Memory
```
You: "Show me my memories about Block deprecation"

→ I find all related memories
→ Display them
→ Zero latency
```
