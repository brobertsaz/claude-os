# Installation Script Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Python 3.13+ Compatibility Error

**Problem:**
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tree-sitter-languages>=1.10.0
```

**Root Cause:**
- System had Python 3.14.0 as default
- `tree-sitter-languages` only supports Python 3.9-3.12
- Script was using incompatible Python version

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `install.sh` to detect and use Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Added intelligent fallback: checks `python3.12`, `python3.11`, then default `python3`
- Shows helpful error message if only Python 3.13+ is available:
  ```
  ❌ Default python3 is version 3.14, but Claude OS requires Python 3.11 or 3.12

  Please install Python 3.11 or 3.12:
    • macOS with Homebrew: brew install python@3.12
    • Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install python3.12
    • Or download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  ```

**Files Changed:**
- `README.md` - Updated badge from `Python 3.11+` to `Python 3.11 | 3.12`
- `README.md` - Added note about Python 3.13+ not supported
- `install.sh` - Added Python version detection (lines 18-58)

### Issue 2: Script Stops After Agent-OS Failure

**Problem:**
```
📦 Installing Agent-OS...
   📥 Cloning Agent-OS from GitHub...
[script stops, no completion message]
```

**Root Cause:**
- Agent-OS repository doesn't exist at `github.com/builder-methods/agent-os`
- `git clone` was redirected to `/dev/null`, failing silently
- Script didn't continue after Agent-OS failure

**Fix Applied:**
- Capture `git clone` output instead of suppressing it
- Check exit status and provide appropriate feedback
- Distinguish between "repo not found" vs "connection error"
- **Script now continues** even if Agent-OS fails (it's optional)
- Set `AGENT_OS_INSTALLED="no"` and continue to completion

**New Error Handling:**
```bash
if [ $CLONE_STATUS -eq 0 ] && [ -d "$AGENT_OS_DIR" ]; then
    echo "   ✅ Agent-OS installed successfully"
else
    if echo "$CLONE_OUTPUT" | grep -q "not found"; then
        echo "   ⚠️  Agent-OS repository is not currently available"
        echo "   Note: Agent-OS integration is coming soon"
    else
        echo "   ❌ Failed to clone Agent-OS"
    fi
    # Script continues...
fi
```

**Files Changed:**
- `install.sh` - Fixed Agent-OS cloning logic (lines 220-245)

### Issue 3: Missing Completion Message

**Problem:**
- Script stopped early, never showed completion summary
- User left wondering if installation succeeded

**Fix Applied:**
- Added prominent completion message with visual separators
- Shows exactly what was installed
- Clear numbered next steps
- Links to documentation

**New Completion Message:**
