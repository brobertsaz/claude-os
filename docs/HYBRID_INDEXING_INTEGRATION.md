# Hybrid Indexing Integration with MCP System

**How the new structural indexes work with Claude OS MCPs**

---

## Current MCP Structure (Before Hybrid Indexing)

When you run `/claude-os-init`, Claude OS creates 4 knowledge bases:

```
{project}-project_memories     # Claude's memory (decisions, patterns)
{project}-project_profile      # Architecture & standards
{project}-project_index        # Codebase index (OLD: slow embedding)
{project}-knowledge_docs       # Your documentation
```

**Problem:** `{project}-project_index` uses slow embedding-based indexing (3-5 hours for Pistn)

---

## NEW MCP Structure (With Hybrid Indexing)

We're adding a **5th knowledge base** and changing how `project_index` works:

```
{project}-code_structure       # NEW! Tree-sitter structural index (FAST - 23 seconds)
{project}-project_index        # UPDATED! Selective semantic index (SMART - 20 mins)
{project}-project_memories     # Unchanged
{project}-project_profile      # Unchanged
{project}-knowledge_docs       # Unchanged
```

---

## How They Work Together

### 🌳 1. code_structure (NEW - Phase 1)

**Purpose:** Fast structural lookup

**Content:**
- Symbol map (all classes, functions, methods)
- Dependency graph (who imports/uses what)
- PageRank scores (what's most important)
- Stored as JSON in the KB

**Speed:** 23 seconds for Pistn (3,117 files)

**Use Cases:**
- "Where is the User class defined?"
- "What methods does SessionsController have?"
- "What files depend on the Authentication module?"
- "What are the most important classes in this project?"

**Storage:**
```json
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "file": "app/models/user.rb",
      "name": "User",
      "kind": "class",
      "line": 1,
      "signature": "class User < ApplicationRecord",
      "importance": 0.95
    },
    ...
  ],
  "dependency_graph": {...},
  "file_index": {...}
}
```

### 📚 2. project_index (UPDATED - Phase 2)

**Purpose:** Deep semantic search

**Content (NEW - Selective!):**
- Top 20% most important files (by PageRank from code_structure)
- All documentation files
- Recently modified files
- Full embeddings for deep semantic search

**Speed:** 20-30 minutes (vs 3-5 hours before)

**Use Cases:**
- "How does authentication work?" (semantic understanding)
- "Explain the payment flow" (conceptual query)
- "What's the pattern for handling errors?" (broad search)

**Key Change:**
- ❌ Before: Embed ALL 3,117 files
- ✅ After: Embed only ~600 most important files (80% reduction!)

## Query Routing Logic

When you ask Claude a question, the system intelligently routes to the right KB:

### Structural Queries → code_structure ⚡
```
User: "Where is User#authenticate defined?"
Claude: [Searches code_structure]
         → Instant lookup in symbol map
         → Returns: app/models/user.rb:15
         → Speed: <1 second
```

### Semantic Queries → project_index 🧠
```
User: "How does authentication work?"
Claude: [Searches project_index]
         → Semantic embedding search
         → Finds auth-related files
         → Synthesizes explanation
         → Speed: ~2-3 seconds
```

### Combined Queries → Both! 🚀
```
User: "What files are related to user authentication?"
Claude: [Searches code_structure for User symbols]
         → Finds User class, authenticate methods
         [Searches project_index for "authentication"]
         → Finds related services, controllers
         → Returns comprehensive answer
```

## Updated `/claude-os-init` Flow

```
Step 1: Gather project info (name, tech stack, etc.)
        ↓
Step 2: Create 5 knowledge bases
        ✅ {project}-code_structure (NEW!)
        ✅ {project}-project_index
        ✅ {project}-project_profile
        ✅ {project}-project_memories
        ✅ {project}-knowledge_docs
        ↓
Step 3: Phase 1 - Structural Indexing (FAST - 23 seconds)
        → Call: POST /api/kb/{project}-code_structure/index-structural
        → Parse with tree-sitter
        → Extract symbols
        → Build dependency graph
        → Compute PageRank
        → Store in code_structure KB
        ✅ READY TO CODE NOW!
        ↓
Step 4: Phase 2 - Semantic Indexing (OPTIONAL - 20 mins)
        User chooses:
        [1] Selective (top 20% + docs) - Recommended
        [2] Full (all files) - Complete but slower
        [3] Skip - Can run later

        If [1] or [2]:
        → Call: POST /api/kb/{project}-project_index/index-semantic
        → Get top files from code_structure (PageRank)
        → Generate embeddings for selected files
        → Store in project_index KB
        → Runs in background!
        ↓
Step 5: Generate CLAUDE.md, .claude/ structure (as before)
        ↓
Step 6: Done! Both indexes ready
```

## Session Start Workflow

When Claude starts a session in a project with hybrid indexing:

```
1. Load CLAUDE.md (as always)
   ↓
2. Check for code_structure KB
   ↓
3. If exists:
   → Load compact repo map (1024 tokens)
   → Include in Claude's system prompt
   → Claude now knows entire codebase structure!
   ↓
4. User asks question
   ↓
5. Route query:
   - Structural? → Search code_structure
   - Semantic? → Search project_index
   - Both? → Search both + synthesize
   ↓
6. Return answer with file references
```

---

## Storage Details

### code_structure KB Storage

**Format:** Single JSON document named `repo_map.json`

**Content:**
```json
{
  "tags": [...],              # All 36,591 symbols
  "dependency_graph": {...},  # NetworkX graph data
  "file_index": {...},        # File → tags mapping
  "symbol_index": {...},      # Symbol → tags mapping
  "total_files": 3117,
  "total_symbols": 36591,
  "indexed_at": 1730419200.0
}
```

**Size:** ~5-10MB for Pistn (much smaller than full embeddings!)

### project_index KB Storage (Updated)

**Format:** Standard documents with embeddings

**Content (Selective Mode):**
- Top 20% files from code_structure (by PageRank): ~600 files
- All documentation: ~50 files
- Total: ~650 files vs 3,117 files (80% reduction!)

**Size:** ~20MB embeddings vs ~100MB before

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Old (Full Embedding) | New (Hybrid) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Knowledge Bases** | 4 | 5 |
| **Index Time** | 3-5 hours | 23 sec + 20 min |
| **Start Coding** | After 3-5 hours | After 23 seconds! |
| **Structural Queries** | Slow semantic search | Instant lookup |
| **Semantic Queries** | Search all files | Search important files |
| **Storage Size** | ~100MB embeddings | ~20MB embeddings + 10MB JSON |
| **Update Speed** | Hours | Minutes |
| **Accuracy** | Good | Better (PageRank priorities) |

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects (Like Pistn)

If Pistn is already set up with old indexing:

```bash
# 1. Run the new structural indexing
cd /Users/iamanmp/Projects/pistn
# In Claude Code:
/claude-os-reindex

# This will:
# ✅ Create code_structure KB
# ✅ Run Phase 1 (23 seconds)
# ✅ Keep existing project_index (don't break things)
# ✅ Offer to re-index project_index selectively

# Result: You get BOTH!
# - Old project_index still works
# - New code_structure is faster
# - Can migrate to selective later
```

### For New Projects

```bash
# Just use /claude-os-init as normal
# It automatically uses hybrid indexing!

cd /path/to/new/project
# In Claude Code:
/claude-os-init

# You get all 5 KBs with hybrid indexing by default
```

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: Finding Code

**User:** "Where is the User model?"

**Claude:**
1. Searches `pistn-code_structure`
2. Instant lookup: `app/models/user.rb:1`
3. Shows: `class User < ApplicationRecord`
4. Total time: <1 second

### Example 2: Understanding Flow

**User:** "How does user authentication work?"

**Claude:**
1. Searches `pistn-code_structure` for "User", "Session", "authenticate"
2. Finds relevant symbols and their locations
3. Searches `pistn-project_index` for semantic understanding
4. Reads relevant files
5. Synthesizes explanation
6. Total time: ~3 seconds

### Example 3: Dependency Analysis

**User:** "What files depend on the User model?"

**Claude:**
1. Loads dependency graph from `pistn-code_structure`
2. Traverses graph for User dependencies
3. Returns: SessionsController, AuthenticationService, etc.
4. Shows: "15 files depend on User model"
5. Total time: <1 second

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Incremental Updates
```python
# When file changes:
- Re-parse only changed file (milliseconds)
- Update dependency graph
- Re-compute PageRank
- Update code_structure KB
# Total: <1 second per file change
```

### 2. Cross-Project Intelligence
```python
# Learn patterns across projects:
- "I've seen this pattern in Project X"
- "Similar to how you did Y in Project Z"
- Share structural insights
```

### 3. Smart Preloading
```python
# At session start:
- Load repo map (always)
- Preload top 10 most important files
- Cache in memory
# Result: Even faster responses
```
