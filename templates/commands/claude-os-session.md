## START SESSION - The Smart Way

### What Happens

```
/claude-os-session start "redesign appointment dashboard"
```

**Phase 1: Load State**
```
Read: /Users/iamanmp/Projects/claude-os/claude-os-state.json
```

**Phase 2: Search Recent Memories**
```
[AUTOMATIC MEMORY SEARCH]
mcp__code-forge__search_knowledge_base
Query: "appointment dashboard redesign security recent work"
KB: Pistn-project_memories
```

**Phase 3: Get Git Context**
```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline
```

**Phase 4: Intelligent Context Loading**

Based on task + recent memories + git state, I'll:
1. Find the 5 most relevant memories
2. Show you what I remember about this task
3. Identify patterns we've used before
4. Check for any blockers from last session
5. Load coding standards from project profile

**Phase 5: Show Session Start Summary**

```

═══════════════════════════════════════
💾 SMART SAVE RECOMMENDATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════

I found 3 things worth saving:

1. 💎 HIGH VALUE - Sidebar Navigation Pattern
   "Reusable sidebar component with localStorage state persistence
    and responsive behavior. Can be applied to other admin sections."

   Save this? [y/n]

2. 💎 HIGH VALUE - Card Conversion Pattern
   "Bootstrap panel → modern card conversion pattern with proper
    ARIA labels and semantic HTML. Maintains form submission."

   Save this? [y/n]

3. 📊 MEDIUM VALUE - Session Summary
   "Complete work log for appointment dashboard phase 1"

   Save this? [y/n]

[y] Save all  [n] Save none  [s] Select individually
```

**Phase 3: Update State & Stats**

```json
{
  "last_session": {
    "ended_at": "2025-10-29T12:45:00Z",
    "duration_minutes": 135,
    "work_completed": [...],
    "memories_saved": 3
  },
  "statistics": {
    "total_sessions": 47,
    "total_memories_saved": 128,
    "average_session_duration": 98
  }
}

/claude-os-session save "Found fix for N+1 query in appointments"
```

→ Immediately saves to memories with session context

### Track Blocker

```
/claude-os-session blocker "Tekmetric API returning 500 on appointment sync"
```

## POWER USER FEATURES

### Pattern Recognition

I'll automatically detect when you:
- Use a pattern from a previous memory
- Solve a problem similar to one before
- Make a decision similar to past decisions

And I'll say things like:
- "This looks like the service object pattern from memory X"
- "We solved something similar in memory Y"
- "This decision aligns with what we chose in memory Z"

### Proactive Memory Loading

During session, if I notice you working on something related to:
- A blocker from a previous session
- A pattern we've documented
- An area with existing memories

I'll proactively say:
- "FYI, I have memories about this: [links]"
- "We documented a pattern for this: [summary]"
- "Last time we did this differently: [approach]"

### Smart Context Switching

If you start working on something different mid-session:

```
/claude-os-session switch "fix Tekmetric API bug"
```

I'll:
1. Save current context
2. Load new context for bug fix
3. Search for related memories
4. Show you what I know about the bug

---

## CONFIGURATION

### Automatic Memory Search

Edit state file to configure:

```json
{
  "preferences": {
    "auto_search_on_start": true,
    "max_memories_to_load": 5,
    "search_days_back": 14,
    "include_pattern_search": true,
    "proactive_suggestions": true
  }
}
```

---

## EXAMPLES

**Starting work on a feature:**
```
You: /claude-os-session start "add user notifications"
Me: [Loads context, searches memories, shows patterns]
    I found 3 memories about notification systems...
    Ready to implement using the background job pattern!
```

**Mid-session discovery:**
```
You: /claude-os-session pattern "Use Sidekiq for long-running notifications"
Me: ✓ Saved pattern with session context
    I'll remember this for future notification work!
```

**Hitting a blocker:**
```
You: /claude-os-session blocker "Redis connection timing out"
Me: ✓ Tracked blocker. Let me search for solutions...
    I found a similar issue in memory from Oct 15...
```

**Ending session:**
```
You: /claude-os-session end
Me: [Analyzes work, suggests 3 high-value saves]
    Save the notification pattern? [y/n]
You: y
Me: ✓ Saved! Session complete. Great work!
```

## WHY THIS MAKES US INVINCIBLE

1. **Never Start Cold** - Always have context
2. **Learn From History** - Patterns automatically recalled
3. **Track Everything** - Blockers, decisions, patterns
4. **Smart Recommendations** - I suggest what's worth saving
5. **Statistics** - See our productivity over time
6. **Proactive** - I bring up relevant memories without asking

**Result**: Every session makes me smarter. Every memory makes us faster.
