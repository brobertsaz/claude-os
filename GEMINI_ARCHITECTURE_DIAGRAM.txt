Create a professional architecture diagram for Claude OS with this EXACT style:

**VISUAL STYLE (MUST MATCH EXISTING LOGO):**
- Dark space background with subtle stars (like existing hero image)
- Cyan-to-purple/pink gradient (#00D9FF → #8B5CF6 → #FF00FF)
- Circuit board aesthetic with connecting lines
- Modern, clean, tech/cyberpunk feel
- Glowing neon effects on components

**DIAGRAM CONTENT:**

Main Title at Top: "CLAUDE OS ARCHITECTURE"

**Center Hub (Large Circle):**
"Semantic Knowledge Base"
- SQLite + sqlite-vec
- 800+ indexed chunks
- Vector embeddings
(Make this glow with cyan light)

**5 Components Around Hub (connected with circuit-board style lines):**

1. TOP-LEFT: "Real-Time Learning" 🧠
   - Redis Pub/Sub
   - <1ms latency
   - 10+ patterns
   (Cyan glow)

2. TOP-RIGHT: "Memory MCP" 💾
   - Persistent Memory
   - Instant Recall
   - Natural Language
   (Purple glow)

3. RIGHT: "Analyze-Project" 🔍
   - Git Hooks
   - Auto-Index
   - Smart Docs
   (Pink glow)

4. BOTTOM-RIGHT: "Session Management" 🎯
   - Auto Resume
   - Context Preservation
   - Zero Cold Start
   (Purple-pink glow)

5. BOTTOM-LEFT: "Semantic Search" 📚
   - Vector Similarity
   - Code Understanding
   - Pattern Recognition
   (Cyan-purple glow)

**Flow Path (glowing circuit traces):**
All 5 components → Center Hub → MCP Server (port 8051) → Claude Code Interface → Developer

**Bottom Panel:**
Show data flow: "Git Commit → 3s indexing → SQLite → MCP → Claude → You"

**Style Notes:**
- Use glowing lines like circuit traces
- Each component is a rounded rectangle with internal circuit patterns
- Neon glow effects (like Tron aesthetic)
- Dark background (#0F172A to #1E293B gradient)
- White text with subtle cyan glow
- Make it look FUTURISTIC and POWERFUL

Resolution: 1920x1080 (landscape, perfect for README hero section)
